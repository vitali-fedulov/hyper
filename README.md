# Hashing float vectors in N-dimensions

This is a working beta version, but now there is an issue https://github.com/vitali-fedulov/hyper/issues/1

Algorithm description:

Please fork if you want use it long term, as the API might change soon.

For me TODO: Add example code.

For you: use test files to get an idea. First make buckets as in buckets_test.go, then hash set as in hashes_test.go.
